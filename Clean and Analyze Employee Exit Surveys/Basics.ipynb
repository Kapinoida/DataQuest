    "# Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "They want us to combine the results for *both* surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. In the guided steps, we'll aim to do most of the data cleaning and get you started analyzing the first question.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data dictionary wasn't provided with the dataset. In a job setting, we'd make sure to meet with a manager to confirm the definitions of the data. For this project, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `dete_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `Cease Date`: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `DETE Start Date`: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `tafe_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- `Reason for ceasing employment`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",
